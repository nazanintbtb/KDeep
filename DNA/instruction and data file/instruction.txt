need package; python3.7,  tensorflow==2.8, cuda and cuDNN if you have GPU.

You need to download the training, validation and testing sets from DeepSEA.
You can download the datasets from "http://deepsea.princeton.edu/media/code/deepsea_train_bundle.v0.9.tar.gz". and
After you have extracted the contents of the tar.gz file, move the 3 .mat files into the KDeep/data/ or KDeep+/data/ folder.
then run below command:
 1-python preprocess_FCGR.py
 2-python KDeep.py or KDeep+.py
 3=python test.py
 

Just test without training model:

 1-If you want just test without train KDeep and KDeep+ model skip download data from deepsea link and
  skip preprocess_FCGR section just extract testdata from tfrecords file then move to data folder.

 2-If you want just test KDeep without training go to colab link (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bdPTxxkB4Gd_R0GBSVfI_R57bUVTjomv?usp=sharing) then run test.py.
  or you can download KDeep.h5 from model of KDeep and install python3.7.3 with tensorflow==2.8 then run test.py 

 3-If you want just test KDeep+ without training, download KDeepp.h5 from model of KDeep+ and install python3.7.3 with tensorflow==2.8 then run test.py
